Learn git basics through these exercises

## How to use

- Fork this repository,
- Clone the fork on your machine,
- Follow the exercices in order (starting at exercice 1),
- Useful links from exercices files are base64 encoded so you don't spoil yourself too easily. To decode them use the `decodeBase64.js` script.
- If you want to learn git, use the command line. Using the EDI (VSCODE, IntelliJ, Atom, ...) interface won't allow you to understand what's going on under the hood. **Use the command line.**
