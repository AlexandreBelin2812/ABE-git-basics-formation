# Exercice 9

## Exercise statement

I hope song lovers like your original song.
But let's make several enhancements to it.

- Modifiy an existing line of your song to make it better,
- Add some new verses at the end of your song.

Now if you remember the previous exercices you noticed that you just made a new `feature`, but also made a `fix`.

Often when you will develop on your application you will modify multiple files at a same time. Adding some new features, fixing some other ones, making some refactoring to make your code easier to read, and sometimes all of that in the same file!

So you worked hard to do everything you had to do, but now you want to make sure your git history looks neat. How can you create separate commits from a single file ?

- Find a way to craft your `feature` and `fix` commits by including only the reelevant part of the file,
- Push the modifications on the remote branch (`feat/my-super-songs`),
- If you are happy with what you have produced, merge the `feat/my-super-songs` branch into the `main` branch.

## Tip

For this particular command, it can be a bit hard to interactively craft your commits. I wrote and article (in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) on how to do it with VSCODE.
