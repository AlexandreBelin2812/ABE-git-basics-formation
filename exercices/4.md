# Exercice 4

## Exercise statement

- Check the git log history.

You can see we have two commits related to the poem. The first create the poem, it's a `feat` commit. The second one fixes the poem, it's a `fix` commit.

This is a totaly valid way to correct and error.

But as you can see in the git log history, the second commit only purpose is to fix the first one.
Now poem lovers may think you are a bad poem writer because you cannot write a good poem on the first try!

Only if we could return to the past to make the history looking just like you perfectly wrote the poem on the first place.

Guess what? You can.

- Delete the last commit about the poem,
- Find a way to modify the initial poem commit with the `Exercice 2` modifications, so the history looks just like it was perfect on the first place. Don't forget to modify the initial commit message so it reflects the corrections (no `Tulips` but `Roses`),
- Check the git log history,
- Push the modifications to the remote branch.
