# Exercice 6

## Exercise statement

You want to add a dialog line to your film scenario.
But before to do that you want your `feat/my-super-scenario` branch to be up to date with the `main` branch.

- Go back to the `feat/my-super-scenario` branch,
- Update your branch using `rebase` so it is now up to date with the `main` branch,
- Check the git log history,
- Modify the scenario to add the dialog line at the end of the file:

```txt
"Wait! But I wanna know!"
```

- Create a commit with a meaningful commit name,
- Push the commit to the remote branch (`feat/my-super-scenario`).
