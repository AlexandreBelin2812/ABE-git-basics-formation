# Exercice 5

## Exercise statement

You want to write a new verse for your poem.

- Modify the poem to add these lines at the end of the file:

```txt
Roses are red
  Violets are blue,
Without you
  My life is poo.
```

- Commit and push the modifications with a meaningful commit name.

Ho crap! You just noticed another error on the poem! It's not about `Honey` but about `Sugar`.

How can we do to change the git history so that it looks like it was perfect on the first place ?
We want to reflect this modification on our two commits about the poem.

- Use `git commit --fixup` to fix the initial poem commit and replace `Honey` with `Sugar`,
- Find a way to rewrite the git history for more than 1 commit,
- Do the modifications (don't forget the commit messages),
- push the modifications to the remote branch (`main`).
